*Enabling the Reproducible Investigation of Waiting Times for Arbitrary Workflows*

Delay effects can impact the Quality of Experience of interactive systems, which motivates research assessing delay impairments, mostly for web based systems. Current studies follow individual methodologies and typically assesses individual and custom-made web pages, whose construction requires expert knowledge in web technologies. A range of native, non-web applications cannot be easily modified for delay studies. Thus, a generalized methodology for assessing delay impacts for a broad range of applications that is assessable to researchers without (web) development expertise is still missing.

In this paper, we aim at closing this gap by describing such a generalized methodology for assessing delay effects in a broad range systems. The goal of this methodology is to  i) lower the barrier for conducting delay assessment studies by avoiding the need for expert knowledge in system development and ii) to allow for reproducible studies.
By this we aim at making a generalized test methodology available to a broad set of researchers to stimulate further research.

This git-repo features the proof of concept implementation of a web-based editor which allows the injection of latencies in arbitrary workflows.
